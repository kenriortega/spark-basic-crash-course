# The official repository for the Rock the JVM Spark Essentials with Scala course

This repository contains the code we wrote during  [Rock the JVM's Spark Essentials with Scala](https://rockthejvm.com/course/spark-essentials) (Udemy version [here](https://udemy.com/spark-essentials)) Unless explicitly mentioned, the code in this repository is exactly what was caught on camera.

## How to install

- install [Docker](https://docker.com)
- either clone the repo or download as zip
- open with IntelliJ as an SBT project
- in a terminal window, navigate to the folder where you downloaded this repo and run `docker-compose up` to build and start the PostgreSQL container - we will interact with it from Spark
- in another terminal window, navigate to `spark-cluster/` 
- Linux/Mac users: build the Docker-based Spark cluster with
```
chmod +x build-images.sh
./build-images.sh
```
- Windows users: build the Docker-based Spark cluster with
```
build-images.bat
```
- when prompted to start the Spark cluster, go to the `spark-cluster` directory and run `docker-compose up --scale spark-worker=3` to spin up the Spark containers with 3 worker nodes
